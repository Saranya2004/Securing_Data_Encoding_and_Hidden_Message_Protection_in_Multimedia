# Securing_Data_Encoding_and_Hidden_Message_Protection_in_Multimedia
This project is developed as part of our final year BE CSE curriculum,  focusing on advanced techniques for secure data transmission. It combines cryptography (AES) and steganography (LSB, MP3 frame header) to ensure confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information embedded within multimedia files.
