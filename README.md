# Securing_Data_Encoding_and_Hidden_Message_Protection_in_Multimedia
This project is developed as part of our final year BE CSE curriculum,  focusing on advanced techniques for secure data transmission. It combines cryptography (AES) and steganography (LSB, MP3 frame header) to ensure confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information embedded within multimedia files.

Key Features
Dual-layer security combining encryption and steganography.
Support for image steganography using LSB method.
Audio steganography using MP3 frame header modification.
Clean, intuitive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Separate modules for:
Text encryption/decryption
Embedding and extracting hidden data from images
Embedding and extracting hidden data from MP3 files

Technologies Used
Cryptography: AES, RSA
Steganography: LSB, MP3 Frame Header
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
